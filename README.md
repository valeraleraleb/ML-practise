| ML#1                  | Prediction of weld size in electron beam welding of thin-walled aerospace structures using ML models|
| ML#2                  | Prediction of final properties of new materials (composite materials)|
| ML#3                  | An application for checking the change in the depth and width of a weld seam using 4 input parameters: IW — welding current value, IF — electron beam focusing current, VW — welding speed, FP — distance from the surface of the samples to the electron-optical|
